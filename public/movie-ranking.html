<h2>Selected by Obatomide</h2>
<hr/>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Marvel Avengers Infinity War</h3></li>
    <p>This one was the most anticipated movies of that year and marvel didn't dissappoint. It was real good watch</p>
    <li><h3>Marvel Avengers End Game</h3></li>
    <p>I know, Avengers again ?, the cliff hanger they left at the end of the first movie had everbody on cokehold and let everbody anticipate this next movie.</p>
    <li><h3>The Spiderman franchise</h3>
        <p>The whole spiderman multiverse is amazing ranging from Toby Maguire's universe to Tom Holland's. They are all great actors.</br>
        But listed below are my Favorite ones!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homecoming</li>
            <li>Far from home</li> 
            <li>Into the spiderverse</li>
        </ul>
    <li><h3>The Kung-fu Tyrant</h3></li>
    <p>This is one of those Moviebox gems, I saw the full series on Youtube tho the CGI may be poor but the storyline is really intriguing</p>
    <li><h3>Kung-fu Hustle</h3></li>
    <p>This one is about 13 years old now, but i rewatched it in school with my housemates and it gave us good laughs</p></li>

<p>These movies are great movies written by some of the greatest writers, directed by the best directors and perfectly excecuted by excellent actors, These movies make me wonder what a great time to be a human... I mean do aliens get this type of luxury too ? haha I bet they also have their own form of entertainment that may include spooking humans lol.</p>
<p>Humans are expendible, I guess that's why we are able to produce awesome entertainment like this Jackie Chan for an example does not 100% use stunts double for his roles in movies, throughout his youthful years he will spend days and nights getting in shape for his roles and will excecute them in near perfection although sometimes he pays the price for some of these actions which is injuries, but hey the medicare system there is very resttuting to the extent that he just has to get injured and will definitely get cured. That is a luxury Nigerians crave. Below is the address of a very competent Nigerian healthcare home that push boudaries in caring for patients</p>
