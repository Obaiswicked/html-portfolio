<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I’m someone who genuinely loves life and the experience of being human. I enjoy simple pleasures like playing tennis and eating good food, alongside creative outlets like playing the saxophone and drawing in my free time. I studied music not to chase the artist’s path, but because I believe music is powerful. Even so, I recognize that it can be a treacherous mission, and I choose to engage with it thoughtfully rather than be consumed by it.
I keep a small circle of friends and have a deep love for learning. Critical thinking is one of my favorite habits it shapes how I understand the world and strengthens my approach to UX design.
<p> I’m currently learning how to code, and I know I’ll be great at it. I question everything, especially ideas that present themselves as “normal” without earning that status. Curiosity and skepticism guide me, but so does empathy.
Family means everything to me. We’ve been through a lot together, and while life isn’t always fair, we’re strong and committed to the journey. Learning hard lessons side by side has only strengthened our bond, our trust, and the belief we have in one another. That shared resilience is one of my greatest sources of pride.</p>
<p>I hold traditional values and have deep respect for discipline, sacrifice, and service. That’s why I greatly respect the Nigerian military individuals who, despite overwhelming odds, choose to defend not just their families but a nation that is often corrupt, ungrateful, and condescending. To face that reality and still stand to fight is more than humanitarian; it’s heroic. They deserve honor for their courage and sacrifice.
I love animals deeply my cat Reed and my dogs Bear and Ruby are family. I believe humans are fragile and expendable, yet the world itself is still a wonderful place. As I write this, I’m listening to J. Cole’s new album—reflecting, learning, and staying present.
